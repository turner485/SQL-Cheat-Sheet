# Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Data Manipulation Language or DML is a subset of operations used to insert, delete, and update data in a database. 
- A DML is often a sublanguage of a more extensive language like SQL; DML comprises some of the operators in the language. 
- Selecting read-only data is closely related and is sometimes also considered a component of a DML, as some users can perform both read and write selection.
- A popular data manipulation language is Structured Query Language or SQL, used to retrieve and manipulate data in a relational database. 
- With SQL, you can perform operations on the database and also use it to create a database. SQL uses specific commands like Create, Drop, Insert, etc., to carry out the required tasks.

DML is an abbreviation for Data Manipulation Language. Represents a collection of programming languages explicitly used to make changes to the database, such as:

- CRUD operations to create, read, update and delete data.
- Using INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands.
- DML commands are often part of a more extensive database language, for example, SQL (structured query language). These DMLs can have a specific syntax to handle data in that language.


DML has two main classifications which are procedural and non-procedural programming, which is also called declarative programming. The SQL dealing with the manipulation of data present in the database belongs to the DML or Data Manipulation Language, including most of the SQL statements.

```
-- Examples of DML Commands-- 
INSERT: command to add new or new value to the database

UPDATE: command to change or update current/existing data to a more recent value within the database

DELETE: command to delete or delete the values or data information of the current table in the database
```
