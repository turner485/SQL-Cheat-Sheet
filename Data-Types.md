# SQL Data Types
SQL data types define the type of value that can be stored in a table column.
- So before you begin building your database table it's a good idea to have a database schema designed.
- Although, you can in fact alter a columns data type after it has been created, it's just good practice.  

SQL data types can be broadly divided into the following categories;
- Numeric data types such as: `INT, TINYINT, BIGINT, FLOAT, REAL` etc.
- Date and Time data types such as: `DATE, TIME, DATETIME` etc.
- Character and String data types such as: `CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT` etc.
- Unicode character string data types such as: `NCHAR, NVARCHAR, NTEXT` etc.
- Binary data types such as: `BINARY, VARBINARY` etc.
- Miscellaneous data types - `CLOB, BLOB, XML, CURSOR, TABLE` etc.
